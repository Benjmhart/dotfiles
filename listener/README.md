# listener

this is a little http listener that just logs out whatever you send in a post body.  

sometimes when setting up a machine, you get something (like an ssh key) which you might want to paste into a service like github,   however you might be working on a tty and not have easy access to the clipboard.  npm install, npm start, and then you can just curl the text to this little server on another device. easy-peasy!
